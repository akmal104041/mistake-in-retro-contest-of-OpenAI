# mistake-in-retro-contest-of-OpenAI

My nickname is mistake in retro contest.
This is my source code of contest, and this maybe a bit messy, I'm sorry for it.
I will reorgnanize it later.

I only try model of rainbow during the contest, so there is no PPO or jerk model in my code. Maybe I can add them later.

In order to adjust some parameters, some classes and functions in the project are copied from the anyrl-py(https://github.com/unixpickle/anyrl-py)
